## Get your sh*t together To-Do List
  My project is a to-do list. This allows multiple users to organize and keep track of the things they have to do. A user can make a list simply by entering their desired username. 
If the username was saved in the server then it will load when the username is entered. The user is brought to a new page with their to-do list table. 
The user can add a row of information to the table that includes their to-do item, the time it will take to complete, the days they have to complete it, 
and any notes. They can delete and modify tasks using the respective buttons. The user also has the ability to log out. The log out function clears their 
cookie and takes them back to the home page. 

To get a feel for how things work when a user is saved in the server try logging in as cat (all lowercase).  

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Adding the ability to handle multiple users
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Adding an extra HTML User page: This made communication with the server a little more challenging, and added extra HTML
and CSS to my project. 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Adding Cookies: This made the communication between pages easier, but was a little bit hard to wrap my head around. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Server Communication to have the user log out: This was a button and a feature that clears cookies and brings users back 
to the main page.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Creating HTML elements from JS: Many of my functions in `scripts.js` create HTML elements that would not otherwise be on 
the page. It was more challenging to coordinate how the page would look. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: CSS: I wrote all of my own `style.css` code. I did not use templates online. I also added additional links to the index page.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Modify Button: The modify button causes a form to appear (filled out already with the selected row information), and then the
form is removed when the user hits "Enter Changes!".
